## Introduction
This semester, I plan to use some of the data I will use for my dissertation which includes data from two Networks in the US across between 7 and 9 sites. The data I will be tidying and exploring is data from parent reports on executive function and mental health in a cohort that is about half autistic and sex balanced. Because the ages of participants vary, some of the data is a little messy. 
```{r}
library(workflowr)


data <- read.csv("data/govdata.csv")


str(data)
```

```
